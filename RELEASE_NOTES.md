# Release Notes - May 2025

## Security Updates

We've updated several key dependencies to address security vulnerabilities, most notably upgrading cryptography from 42.0.0 to 44.0.1 to fix CVE-2024-12797. All dependencies now follow strict version pinning with both lower and upper bounds to prevent unexpected breaking changes. We've implemented comprehensive dependency security scanning using pip-audit (replacing Safety) for continuous vulnerability monitoring in both development and CI environments. This update also includes improvements to our CI security pipeline, with automated scanning of both production and development dependencies. The complete list of secured dependencies and version constraints can be found in requirements-prod.txt and requirements-dev.txt, maintained through our reproducible build process.

## Addressing High Priority Security Tasks

We've completed the three highest priority tasks from our security roadmap: 1) Updated cryptography from >=42.0.0,<43.0.0 to >=44.0.1,<45.0.0 to address CVE-2024-12797, a critical security vulnerability; 2) Added comprehensive upper bounds to all dependencies in requirements.txt to prevent automatic updates to potentially incompatible versions; and 3) Updated setup.py to match dependency constraints in requirements.txt, ensuring consistent builds regardless of installation method. These changes provide immediate mitigation against known vulnerabilities while establishing a foundation for ongoing security maintenance. All updates have been thoroughly tested to ensure they maintain full compatibility with existing functionality.

## Comprehensive Security Hardening and Modernization

We've implemented multiple layers of security hardening to strengthen our cryptographic operations. Key improvements include implementing comprehensive constant-time operations across all sensitive data comparisons and MAC verifications, preventing timing side-channel attacks. Our memory security has been fortified through systematic auditing of secure memory zeroing practices, ensuring all sensitive data (keys, passwords) is properly cleared after use, and implementing a secure memory allocator specifically for cryptographic data. We've fortified error handling to prevent information leakage while standardizing error messages to prevent fingerprinting. Thread safety has been improved with thread-local timing jitter and comprehensive testing. We've also made significant code quality improvements, including fixing nonce handling in XChaCha20Poly1305, addressing KeystoreError references, and consolidating test files. For broader compatibility, we've added Python 3.13 support for the Whirlpool hash module and verified all functionality across this latest Python version. These enhancements collectively strengthen our cryptographic foundations while maintaining compatibility and performance.

## Infrastructure and Security Enhancements

Beyond dependency updates, we've significantly improved our development and deployment infrastructure. We implemented a robust dependency management system using pip-tools, creating lock files (requirements-prod.txt, requirements-dev.txt) for reproducible builds. Our security posture has been strengthened with pre-commit hooks for local security scanning and a multi-stage CI pipeline that performs vulnerability scanning, code security analysis via Bandit, and generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in CycloneDX format. The custom gitlab_dependency_scan.py script provides reliable CI security scanning that integrates with GitLab's security dashboard. These enhancements are designed to support sustainable development while maintaining a strong security foundation.
