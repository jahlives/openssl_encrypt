[WIP] Add configurable data encryption algorithms for Kyber (v5 metadata)

This initial implementation adds support for selecting different symmetric 
encryption algorithms when using Kyber. This is an EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE
currently in early testing phase and NOT YET READY for production use.

## Implementation Details

* Added new metadata format (v5) with encryption_data parameter in encryption section
* Modified PQCipher class to support multiple symmetric encryption algorithms
* Created conversion functions between v4 and v5 metadata formats
* Added CLI support with new --encryption-data parameter
* Updated template files to include encryption_data option
* Added comprehensive documentation and examples
* Implemented unit and integration tests for the new functionality

## Available Algorithms

When using Kyber, users can now select one of the following for data encryption:
- aes-gcm (default)
- aes-gcm-siv
- aes-ocb3
- aes-siv
- chacha20-poly1305
- xchacha20-poly1305

## Current Status

IMPORTANT: This is an early testing feature that passes its specific unit tests
but breaks compatibility with some existing functionality. DO NOT use in 
production environments.

* The core encryption_data feature works correctly
* Direct PQCipher usage with different algorithms works
* The feature-specific unit tests are passing
* However, this implementation currently breaks several other tests:
  - Dual encryption tests
  - Some AES-GCM tests
  - Binary file encryption/decryption tests

These compatibility issues will be addressed in future commits before this
feature is ready for production use.

## Future Work

Next steps before this feature can be merged:
1. Fix compatibility issues with existing tests
2. Update dual encryption to work with v5 metadata
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage
4. Improve error handling for unsupported algorithms
5. Add benchmarking for performance comparison
